    "In this program I use the Monte Carlo method to simulate the ferromagnetic properties of a two dimensional lattice of spins using Python.  The Ising Model has exact solutions in one dimension and two dimensions, but beyond one dimension analytical analysis becomes difficult.  Using the Monte Carlo method where an inital lattice of randomly oriented spins are flipped until the system comes to an equilibrium I am able to simulate the ferromagnetic properties at various temperatures."

    "The Ising Model is a model used to describe ferromagnetism in materials.  Ferromagnetism typically occurs in a material below a critical temperature called the Curie temperature.  Above this temperature, the thermal motion of the ions dominate and the material loses its magnetization.  Below this temperature the material experiences one of three phases: ferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism and antiferromagnetism.  Ferromagnetism is the case where all the spins or magnetic moments align to form a net magnetization.  Ferrimagnetism is the case where there are some spins that are anti-aligned but where there is still a net magnetization.  Lastly, antiferromagnetism is the case where half the spins are aligned in one direction and the other half are aligned in the opposite direction so that they cancel each other to create no net magnetization.

    "In its most basic sense it models the interaction between spins in a ferromagnetic material.  For a system that has $N$ sites that contain one spin magnetic moment, each site $S_ij$ can have one of two possible orientations, $S_{ij} = 1$ (spin up) or $S_{ij} = -1$ (spin down).  In a two dimensional lattice configuration each spin site has four nearest neighbors (above, below, left and right) and the Ising Model simplifies the analysis of the ferromagnet by taking into account only the interactions of directly neighboring spins.  The energy of the system is given by the equation below:"

In this simulation the external magnetic field is taken to be zero.  "

    "The Monte Carlo method in analyzing the Ising Model is prety straightforward.  The initial lattice system is in a state of random spin configurations.  We then choose a site on the lattice randomly and calculate the change in energy of the new configuration.  Since we are only concerned with the nearest neighbor interactions we do not need to calculate the energy of the entire system again.  We simply calculate the change in energy since we know which possible values it must take for a given spin flip."

If the change in energy is greater than zero then we accept it with a probability.  Since there is still a chance that the system will go to the higher energy state (however improbable) we must take this into account.  The probability that we use is taken from statistical mechanics and is called the partition function which is given below:"

If we flip a spin and it ends up having a positive change in energy, we accept this new configuration only if $p>x$.  If $p$ is less than $x$ then we reject the flip and keep the old configuration. "

    "The user is allowed to input the number of sites on each row of the two dimensional lattice, the width of each cell in the interface simulation and the number of Monte Carlo steps that are taken in the simulation.  Because the screen on the computer is only so large, I find that keeping the number of sites between 50 and 75 is ideal.  Similarly the width of each cell should be reasonably set.  The width is given in pixels and a width between 10 and 15 is good. Lastly the number of steps in the simulation has one main visual effect on the interface.  If the number of Monte Carlo steps are small then the spins will flip quickly on the interface simulation.  If the number of steps is large then the spins will flip more slowly on the interface."
